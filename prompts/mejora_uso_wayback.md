Prompt: This python app is  afoundational work for a term analyzer of historiacl web archive. For this, I used the internet archive API.

Improve the program so it takes only webpages. Also, improve the performance of term processing, and add more key terms that are "too common" in englsh to filter out..

Then, do a first version fo a streamlit frontend for this.
